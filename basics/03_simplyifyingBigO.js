//Constants dont matter

// O(2n) => O(n)
// O(2000) => O(1)
// O(13n^2) => O(n^2)

// Smaller terms dont matter

/* 
 O(n+10) => O(n)
 O(1000n+50) => O(n)
 O(n^2 + 5n + 8) => O(n^2)

/*
 Big O shorthands 

 1. Aritmetic operations are constants 

 2. Variable assignments are also  constant 

 3. Acessing elements in an array (by index) is constant , same  with objects 

 In a loop , the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside the loop { in nested loops complexity increases}
