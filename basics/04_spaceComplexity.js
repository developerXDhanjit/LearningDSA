/* 

analyze the complexity taken by the memory , big O can still be used 

We will discuss about auxilary space complexity , meaning only the amount of space taken by the algorithm

*/

/* Rules of Thumb 

1. booleans , numbers , undefined are constant space
2. Strings require O(n) space
3. Reference types generally take O(n) , n is length or keys of objects
